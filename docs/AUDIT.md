# Architecture Audit — Current State of FIDScript Deploy

> **Date:** 2026-06-16
> **Status:** Pre-hardening snapshot. This document is the honest record of what the Phase 00–23 scaffold actually does (and does not do) today.
> **Purpose:** Source of truth for "where are we." The rewritten phase documents (`docs/phases/phase-XX.md`) are the forward-looking specs for "what each phase must deliver to be production-grade."

## Headline

**As written, FIDScript Deploy does not compile, cannot be installed on a VPS, and roughly three-quarters of what is marked "COMPLETE" is scaffolding** — controllers and services that read and write Prisma rows while doing little or none of the real infrastructure work each feature promises. The defect was never caught because **nothing was ever compiled or run.** The "23 phases complete" status was an illusion created by the absence of verification.

The one genuinely substantial, real piece is `apps/api` — a NestJS application with 23 modules and real Prisma data access. It is simply **undelivered**: it does not build, its schema is not migrated, and it is not containerized. Everything else (Dashboard, CLI, MCP, Skills, SDK, Installer) is placeholder, partial, duplicate, or missing.

---

## A. Build / Run Blockers (why nothing works end-to-end)

These are the highest-severity findings. Until they are resolved, **no feature can be demonstrated**.

| # | Defect | Evidence | Effect |
|---|--------|----------|--------|
| 1 | AI + Marketplace modules import a file that does not exist | `ai.service.ts`, `marketplace.service.ts` import `EventsService` from `../events/events.service.js`; the real file is `event.service.ts` (singular), class `EventService` | Compile failure |
| 2 | AI dependency-injection token mismatch | `ai.service.ts` injects `@Inject('AI_PROVIDER')` (string); `ai.module.ts` provides `AIProvider` (symbol) | Boot failure even after compile |
| 3 | ESM/CommonJS landmine | `apps/api` is `module: commonjs` + `"type":"module"` + every import uses `.js` extensions | Emitted `require('./x.js')` resolves to files that do not exist |
| 4 | Workspace packages point at unbuilt `dist/` | `@fidscript/types`, `@fidscript/shared`, `@fidscript/events` declare `main: ./dist/index.js`, never built | Imports resolve to nothing |
| 5 | No Dockerfiles for the app itself | `find apps -iname Dockerfile*` is empty | `docker compose up` fails on `api`/`dashboard` build |
| 6 | Compose cannot connect to Postgres | `$(cat /run/secrets/...)` in `environment:` is not substituted by Compose | `DATABASE_URL` is a literal broken string |
| 7 | No Prisma migrations, no seed file | No `migrations/` dir; `db:seed` points at a non-existent `prisma/seed.ts` | Database never receives a schema or an admin user |
| 8 | Installer does not deploy the app | `install.sh` copies only `installer/`, never builds/starts app containers; `mkdir ".../{postgres,redis}"` brace-expansion bug | A fresh VPS yields a Traefik 404 |
| 9 | MCP server SDK missing from lockfile | `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is absent from `pnpm-lock.yaml` | MCP server cannot start |
| 10 | Nothing committed | Only 2 commits existed; all of `apps/`, `installer/`, `packages/`, `docs/` were untracked | All work existed only in the working tree |

### "If I run install.sh on a fresh VPS today, what works?"

- **Works:** the infrastructure stack comes up — Postgres, Redis, NATS, MinIO, Stalwart, Traefik start healthy (real images, real healthchecks).
- **Does not work:** the API and dashboard fail to build (no Dockerfiles, broken compose build contexts); the database has no schema (zero migrations) and no admin user (no seed file); the MCP server cannot start (SDK not installed); there is no CLI; the dashboard is a single title page; the "Claude skill" is plain markdown with no `SKILL.md` frontmatter. `deploy.fidscript.com` shows a Traefik 404.

## B. The Event Bus (the linchpin)

**Verdict: STUB — and deceptive.** It looks like a real NATS integration but is not.

- **Wrong package.** `event.service.ts` imports `nats.ws`, which is the **browser WebSocket client**. The Node package is `nats`. It will not behave as a durable JetStream publisher.
- **Zero subscribers anywhere.** No `.subscribe`, `@OnEvent`, or consumer exists in `apps/api/src`. Events are **write-only**. The platform's "Event Driven" rule is satisfied only in the publish direction.
- **Silent degradation.** With `NATS_URL` unset (every fresh VPS), `emit()` silently drops to `logger.debug`. Events vanish with no record.
- **No JetStream stream is ever created**, so even with the correct package, `publish('events.<type>')` returns `NoStreamResponse`.
- **Duplicated, divergent schema.** `packages/events` defines a rich `PlatformEvent` + `EventType` union that the service ignores. `docs/EVENT_CATALOG.md` documents subject schemes (`identity.user.*`) that match nothing in the code.
- **Publishing IS broad** — user, project, deployment, domain, database, function, email, queue, cron, and monitoring events all emit. The surface area exists; it just dead-ends.

**This is the correct #1 fix.** An in-process `@nestjs/event-emitter` fallback alone would make the platform react to its own events (audit logs, webhooks, realtime fan-out) even with zero external infrastructure.

## C. Module Reality

| Module | Status | The uncomfortable truth |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Auth** | BROKEN | Login returns a raw hex token, but `JwtStrategy` verifies it as a JWT → **every guarded route returns 401**. `JWT_SECRET` defaults to `change-me`. Magic link queries `where user.email === token` and never sends email. No MFA. bcrypt itself is real. |
| **Projects** | PARTIAL | The best module — real multi-tenant CRUD, real RBAC, real access checks. But env-vars are stored in plaintext, there are no invites, and subdomains are never routed. Unreachable until auth is fixed. |
| **Deployments** | STUB | "Deploy" inserts a row with `status:'PENDING'`. `triggerBuild`/`completeBuild` flip a column and have **zero callers** — dead code. No Docker, no build, no container, no `deploymentUrl`. The core product promise is not implemented. |
| **Domains** | STUB | `checkDns()` returns `true` — every domain "verifies" instantly. No Cloudflare calls, no Let's Encrypt, `'YOUR_SERVER_IP'` placeholder. |
| **Storage** | PARTIAL | The one honest subsystem — real MinIO SDK calls, real uploads, real presigned URLs. But `createBucket`/`deleteBucket` only write rows (no `makeBucket`), fake etag, `getPublicUrl` leaks `http://localhost:9000`. |
| **Email (Stalwart)** | STUB | The API never talks to Stalwart. "Send" writes a row. `verifyDomain` returns `{dkim:true,spf:true,dmarc:true}` hardcoded. Mailboxes live only in Postgres. Stalwart has no published ports, no mounted certs, no DKIM keys, no MX/DNS step. Nowhere near the "internal mail server" vision. |
| **Databases** | STUB | "Provision" inserts a row and fabricates a connection string. No `CREATE DATABASE`, no container. Backup/restore/rotate are commented-out stubs returning `size:0`. No PgBouncer service, no query console. |
| **Functions** | PARTIAL (dangerous) | Actually executes code via `child_process.exec` — but **zero sandboxing**, Docker socket mounted, `/tmp` storage, `memoryMb` ignored, env vars not injected, Python payload is shell-injection-prone. A function can read `/etc/shadow`. |
| **Queues** | PARTIAL | Real REST queue logic + DLQ, but it is a **Prisma table**, not a broker. No NATS. No worker — messages sit `pending` until a client polls. No visibility timeout → messages lost on consumer crash. |
| **Scheduler** | PARTIAL | Real `cron` library, fires HTTP endpoints while alive — but **no `OnModuleInit`**, so **every restart silently disables all cron jobs**. `functionId` targets are ignored. `nextRunAt` reports a time that never fires. No distributed lock. |
| **Realtime** | STUB | A Socket.IO gateway exists with JWT auth and channel handlers — but `@nestjs/websockets`/`socket.io` are not in dependencies, so it cannot instantiate. Platform events do not flow to clients. Presence is in-memory only. `validateChannelToken` returns `true`. |
| **Monitoring** | PARTIAL | Real metric rows + alert rule evaluation — but **no `/metrics` Prometheus endpoint**, `durationSeconds` is ignored, and **notification channels are never dispatched**. A firing alert produces a row and a debug log. |
| **Logging** | PARTIAL | Real ingestion + genuinely good cursor-paginated query. But `retentionDays` is never enforced, there is no retention sweep, and no log shipping. |
| **Templates** | STUB | `{{var}}` substitution is real, but "generate a project" creates **one Project row** and returns a string that goes nowhere. No files, no repo, no deploy. |
| **AI** | STUB/broken | The Gemini call itself is real — but the module will not compile (blockers #1, #2). No streaming, key passed as a query parameter, no retry/budget. |
| **Marketplace** | PARTIAL/broken | Rating aggregation genuinely works. But the module will not compile (#1), and **admin actions (approve/reject/verify/feature) have no role guard — any authenticated user can approve their own item.** Reviews never display (`isVerified:false` forever). |

---

## D. The Three Access Surfaces

| Surface | Status | Reality |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Dashboard** | STUB | `apps/dashboard` is Next.js 15 but has **one page**: an `<h1>FIDScript Deploy</h1>`. No routes, no screens, no API calls, no auth. `packages/ui` has 8 real components used by nothing. The root `src/pages/*` is a broken orphan Vite scaffold (missing `main.tsx`, missing dependencies) — should be deleted. |
| **CLI** | MISSING | No CLI exists — no `bin`, no `commander`/`inquirer`/`yargs` anywhere. One of the three required surfaces is simply absent. |
| **MCP** | PARTIAL | The modular `tools/*` + `handlers.ts` + `server.ts` path is real and live (real HTTP calls). But `index.ts` is a **1526-line dead duplicate** (zero importers — delete it), the SDK is not in the lockfile so it cannot start, and `install.sh` tries to `npx` an unpublished package. |
| **Skills** | STUB | `fidscript-skill.md` is plain documentation with no `SKILL.md` frontmatter — not an installable skill. References fictional commands and repositories. |
| **SDK** | PARTIAL | Two duplicated SDKs (`apps/sdk` axios + `packages/sdk` fetch), both named `@fidscript/sdk` → arbitrary resolution. `apps/sdk` is stronger but is **missing a `databases` module**. Neither is published. |

## E. Recommended Hardening Tracks

The "build Phase 24" mindset is retired. Work proceeds in dependency-correct tracks, **each verified on the VPS before the next begins**.

- **Track 0 — Make it build & run.** Resolve blockers #1–#10. *Exit criterion: `docker compose up` on a fresh VPS yields a reachable `deploy.fidscript.com` where a user can register, log in, and call a guarded endpoint.*
- **Track 1 — The event bus.** `nats.ws` → `nats` + in-process `@nestjs/event-emitter` fallback + first real consumer + reconcile `packages/events`. Everything downstream depends on this.
- **Track 2 — Core platform reality**, in dependency order: Auth → Deployments → Domains → Storage → Databases → Email/Stalwart → Functions (sandboxing) → Queues → Scheduler → Realtime → Monitoring → Logging.
- **Track 3 — The three surfaces:** real Dashboard, CLI from scratch, fix & ship MCP, real Skill, dedupe SDK.
- **Track 4 — Polish:** Templates, AI, Marketplace (including the privilege-escalation fix).

## How to use this document

The rewritten phase documents reference this audit's sections for "current state." When a phase doc says *"Current state: STUB — see AUDIT.md §C,"* it means: the scaffold exists but does not do the real work, and the phase's job is to make it real.
