Phase: Documentation-first (pre-implementation)

Completed:
- Wrote the full frontend blueprint: F00–F11 phase specs, 12 service specs, 19 per-screen
  specs, 30/30 component specs, 5 backend-inventory cluster files.
- Ran Phase D0 validation: 0 broken cross-references; implementation matrix (13/16 buildable
  now); API readiness ~89%; UX consistency pass.
- Created the contract layer: `docs/VALIDATION.md`, `docs/backend-prerequisites.md` (9 Open,
  A→B→C phased), `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md`, `docs/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`,
  `docs/EXECUTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/technical-debt.md`.
- Added 7 product-rationale ADRs (029–035) to `DECISIONS.md`; froze the blueprint (CLAUDE.md
  rules 16–20).

Decision:
- Freeze the documentation as the contract before any code. Implementation begins with Phase A
  (platform correctness), then Phase B, then F02 as the first vertical slice.

Impact:
- No code changes this session — documentation only. Backend remains as verified
  (`docs/AUDIT.md` §C + this session's deployment/functions proofs).

## 2026-06-20 (later) — Stage 0A opened

Phase: Phase A (platform correctness)

Completed:
- Ran the execution protocol's first step (research) on the auth code before editing.
- Found **Phase A was already implemented**: `auth-session.service.ts` (signed refresh JWT +
  sessionId in access JWT), `auth-token.service.ts:refreshToken` (rotation), `jwt.strategy.ts`
  (surfaces sessionId), `auth-login.service.ts:logout` (revokes the Session row),
  `common/secrets.ts:resolveJwtSecret` (JWT_SECRET_FILE, fails-closed).
- Regenerated the stale Prisma client (`sourceUrl` was in `schema.prisma` but not the generated
  client) → `pnpm --filter @fidscript/api typecheck` now clean.
- Flipped `PREREQ-AUTH-5/6/7` to ✅ Closed in the registry with verification notes.

Unexpected issues:
- `docs/AUDIT.md` "Auth: BROKEN" verdict (2026-06-16) was **stale** — the hardening happened
  after the audit but the audit was never updated. Caught by rule 12 (research before implement).
- The repo failed typecheck on a *deployments* file (`sourceUrl`) due to a stale Prisma client,
  not an auth problem — fixed with `prisma generate`.

Decision:
- Do NOT re-implement Phase A. Record it as closed-by-verification and move to Phase B, which is
  confirmed still genuinely missing (mustChangePassword, change-password, magic-code, /me flag).

Impact:
- No auth code changes (it was already correct). Prisma client regenerated. Registry, AUDIT,
  CURRENT_PHASE, and this log updated to reflect reality. Phase B is now the active work.
